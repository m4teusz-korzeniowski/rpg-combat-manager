# RPG Combat Manager

This project is a simple yet powerful scene and battle manager designed to help manage and automate combat scenarios for RPG games, tailored for personal use and a small group of friends. It eliminates the hassle of manual state tracking, effect calculations, and condition management during battles.

Currently, it provides a basic CRUD REST API for managing units, skills, talents, and effects based on reusable templates. You can create and use predefined enemies or add your own custom units.

## Tech Stack

- Spring Boot (Java) for backend REST API
- MongoDB for data persistence
- Jakarta Validation for request validation

## Current Plans

- Develop a React frontend to create, view, and manage combat scenes and units
- Implement live state updates and effect handling on the frontend
- Extend the system for more complex combat rules and scenario automation
